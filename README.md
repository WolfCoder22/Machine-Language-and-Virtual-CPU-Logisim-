The images
-Screenshots of a virtual CPU I built using logisim
-contains many structures that each had their own circuit design, inluding the ALU and DSHIM (aslo displayed in file)
-The CPU was able to run Machine language (specifically y86) code


isMutipleOf3
-a Machine Language text file (y86) that determines if a four bit binary nuber first is a number 
consists of Binary Coded Decimals digits only, then dtermines if it's a mutiple of 3
-crazy to think all this happens in such simple operations'
